A weather forecasting application that uses your device's IP address to obtain and render the weather condition of your location for the week. 
It provides many weather data including wind speed, humidity and pressure. 

This application was developed with React.js and SCSS module.
I used Open meteo Weather API to get the weather data Which corresponds to his current location, and GeoJs API to get the user's
current location.
